Node Affinity takes precedence over Selector :

> To begin with, I checked your deployment yaml file which was having selector and affinity. Please allow me to mention you that affinity take precedence above selector, that is the reason why it is taking only one condition.

> To mitigate this issue and meet both the condition please configure "nodeselector" as well in the container as mentioned in below yaml file:-

`````````

I hope this information serves you well.
